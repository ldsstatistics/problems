## Book of Mormon and DNA Studies

<br>

Although the primary purpose of the Book of Mormon is more spiritual than historical, some people have wondered whether the migrations it describes are compatible with scientific studies of ancient America. The discussion has centered on the field of population genetics and developments in DNA science. Some have contended that the migrations mentioned in the Book of Mormon did not occur because **the majority of DNA identified to date in modern native peoples most closely resembles that of eastern Asian populations.**

The evidence assembled to date suggests that **the majority of Native Americans carry largely Asian DNA**. Scientists theorize that in an era that predated Book of Mormon accounts, **a relatively small group of people migrated from northeast Asia to the Americas by way of a land bridge that connected Siberia to Alaska. These people, scientists say, spread rapidly to fill North and South America and were likely the primary ancestors of modern American Indians.**

The 2006 update to the introduction of the Book of Mormon reflects this understanding by stating that Book of Mormon peoples were **“among the ancestors of the American Indians.”**

[Footnote 10] The introduction, which is not part of the text of the Book of Mormon, previously stated that the Lamanites were the **“principal ancestors of the American Indians.”**

8 And behold, it is wisdom that **this land should be kept as yet from the knowledge of other nations**; for behold, many nations would overrun the land, that there would be no place for an inheritance.

9 Wherefore, I, Lehi, have obtained a promise, that inasmuch as those whom the Lord God shall bring out of the land of Jerusalem shall keep his commandments, they shall prosper upon the face of this land; and **they shall be kept from all other nations, that they may possess this land unto themselves**. And if it so be that they shall keep his commandments they shall be blessed upon the face of this land, and there shall be none to molest them, nor to take away the land of their inheritance; and they shall dwell safely forever.

8 And it came to pass that they did multiply and spread, and did go forth from the land southward to the land northward, and did spread insomuch that **they began to cover the face of the whole earth**, from the sea south to the sea north, from the asea west to the sea east.

8 And thus you shall take your journey into the regions westward, **unto the land of Missouri, unto the borders of the Lamanites**.
