## Race and the Priesthood

<br>

Despite this modern reality, **for much of its history—from the mid-1800s until 1978—the Church did not ordain men of black African descent to its priesthood or allow black men or women to participate in temple endowment or sealing ordinances**.

**In 1852, President Brigham Young publicly announced that men of black African descent could no longer be ordained to the priesthood**, though thereafter blacks continued to join the Church through baptism and receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost. Following the death of Brigham Young, **subsequent Church presidents restricted blacks from receiving the temple endowment or being married in the temple**. Over time, Church leaders and members advanced many theories to explain the priesthood and temple restrictions. None of these explanations is accepted today as the official doctrine of the Church.

The **curse of Cain** was often put forward as justification for the priesthood and temple restrictions. Around the turn of the century, another explanation gained currency: **blacks were said to have been less than fully valiant in the premortal battle against Lucifer** and, as a consequence, were restricted from priesthood and temple blessings.

Like other groups of Christians at this time, however, **many white Saints wrongly viewed black people as inferior, believing that black skin was the result of God’s curse on the biblical figures Cain and Ham. Some had even begun to teach the false idea that black skin was evidence of a person’s unrighteous actions in the premortal life.**

**Brigham Young shared some of these views**, but before leaving Winter Quarters, he had also told a mixed-race Saint that all people were alike unto God. “Of one blood has God made all flesh,” he had said. “We don’t care about the color.”

21 And he had caused the **cursing** to come upon them, yea, even a sore **cursing, because of their iniquity**. For behold, they had hardened their hearts against him, that they had become like unto a flint; wherefore, **as they were white, and exceedingly fair and delightsome, that they might not be enticing unto my people the Lord God did cause a skin of blackness** to come upon them.

22 And thus saith the Lord God: I will cause that they shall be **loathsome** unto thy people, save they shall repent of their iniquities.

23 And **cursed shall be the seed of him that mixeth with their seed; for they shall be cursed even with the same cursing**. And the Lord spake it, and it was done.

24 And because of their cursing which was upon them **they did become an idle people, full of mischief and subtlety, and did seek in the wilderness for beasts of prey**.

25 And the Lord God said unto me: They shall be **a scourge unto thy seed, to stir them up in remembrance of me**; and inasmuch as they will not remember me, and hearken unto my words, they shall scourge them even unto destruction.

14 And it came to pass that those Lamanites who had united with the Nephites were numbered among the Nephites;

15 And **their curse was taken from them, and their skin became white** like unto the Nephites;

Today, **the Church disavows the theories advanced in the past that black skin is a sign of divine disfavor or curse**, or that it reflects unrighteous actions in a premortal life; that mixed-race marriages are a sin; or that blacks or people of any other race or ethnicity are inferior in any way to anyone else.

Between 1884 and 1904, Jane periodically contacted Church leaders—John Taylor, Wilford Woodruff, Zina D. H. Young, and Joseph F. Smith—and sought permission to receive her temple endowment and to be sealed. At that time, black Latter-day Saint men and women were not allowed to participate in most temple ordinances. In 1888, stake president Angus M. Cannon authorized Jane to perform baptisms for her deceased kindred. Church leaders eventually allowed her to be **sealed by proxy into the Joseph Smith family as a servant** in 1894, a unique occurrence. Although she did not receive the temple endowment or family sealings during her lifetime, these ordinances were performed in her behalf in 1979.

In 1852, Church leaders serving in Utah’s legislature debated what to do about black slavery in Utah Territory. **Brigham Young and Orson Spencer spoke in favor of legalizing and regulating slavery**, allowing enslaved men and women to be brought to the territory but prohibiting the enslavement of their descendants and requiring their consent before any move.

23 The land of Egypt being first discovered by a woman, who was the daughter of Ham, and the daughter of Egyptus, which in the Chaldean signifies Egypt, which signifies that which is forbidden;

24 When this woman discovered the land it was under water, who afterward settled her sons in it; and thus, **from Ham, sprang that race which preserved the curse** in the land.

25 Now the first government of Egypt was established by Pharaoh, the eldest son of Egyptus, the daughter of Ham, and it was after the manner of the government of Ham, which was patriarchal.

26 Pharaoh, being a righteous man, established his kingdom and judged his people wisely and justly all his days, seeking earnestly to imitate that order established by the fathers in the first generations, in the days of the first patriarchal reign, even in the reign of Adam, and also of Noah, his father, who blessed him with the blessings of the earth, and with the blessings of wisdom, but **cursed him as pertaining to the Priesthood**.

27 Now, Pharaoh being of that lineage by which he could not have the right of Priesthood, notwithstanding the Pharaohs would fain claim it from Noah, through Ham, therefore my father was led away by their idolatry;

22 And Enoch also beheld the residue of the people which were the sons of Adam; and they were a mixture of all the seed of Adam save it was the seed of Cain, **for the seed of Cain were black, and had not place among them**.
