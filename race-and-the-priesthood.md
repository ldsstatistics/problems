## Race and the Priesthood

Like other groups of Christians at this time, however, **many white Saints wrongly viewed black people as inferior**, believing that black skin was the result of God’s curse on the biblical figures Cain and Ham. Some had even begun to teach the false idea that black skin was evidence of a person’s unrighteous actions in the premortal life.

**Brigham Young shared some of these views**, but before leaving Winter Quarters, he had also told a mixed-race Saint that all people were alike unto God. “Of one blood has God made all flesh,” he had said. “We don’t care about the color.”

In 1850, the U.S. Congress created Utah Territory, and the U.S. president appointed Brigham Young to the position of territorial governor. Southerners who had converted to the Church and migrated to Utah with their slaves raised the question of slavery’s legal status in the territory. In two speeches delivered before the Utah territorial legislature in January and February 1852, **Brigham Young announced a policy restricting men of black African descent from priesthood ordination**. At the same time, President Young said that at some future day, black Church members would “have [all] the privilege and more” enjoyed by other members.

The justifications for this restriction echoed the widespread ideas about racial inferiority that had been used to argue for the **legalization of black “servitude” in the Territory of Utah**. According to one view, which had been promulgated in the United States from at least the 1730s, blacks descended from the same lineage as the biblical Cain, who slew his brother Abel. Those who accepted this view believed that God’s “curse” on Cain was the mark of a dark skin. Black servitude was sometimes viewed as a second curse placed upon Noah’s grandson Canaan as a result of Ham’s indiscretion toward his father. Although slavery was not a significant factor in Utah’s economy and was soon abolished, the restriction on priesthood ordinations remained.

Following the death of Brigham Young, **subsequent Church presidents restricted blacks from receiving the temple endowment or being married in the temple**. Over time, Church leaders and members advanced many theories to explain the priesthood and temple restrictions. None of these explanations is accepted today as the official doctrine of the Church.

The **curse of Cain** was often put forward as justification for the priesthood and temple restrictions. Around the turn of the century, another explanation gained currency: **blacks were said to have been less than fully valiant** in the premortal battle against Lucifer and, **as a consequence, were restricted from priesthood and temple blessings**.

21 And he had caused the **cursing** to come upon them, yea, even a sore **cursing, because of their iniquity**. For behold, they had hardened their hearts against him, that they had become like unto a flint; wherefore, **as they were white, and exceedingly fair and delightsome, that they might not be enticing unto my people the Lord God did cause a skin of blackness** to come upon them.

22 And thus saith the Lord God: I will cause that they shall be **loathsome** unto thy people, save they shall repent of their iniquities.

23 And **cursed shall be the seed of him that mixeth with their seed; for they shall be cursed even with the same cursing**. And the Lord spake it, and it was done.

24 And because of their cursing which was upon them **they did become an idle people, full of mischief and subtlety, and did seek in the wilderness for beasts of prey**.

25 And the Lord God said unto me: They shall be **a scourge unto thy seed, to stir them up in remembrance of me**; and inasmuch as they will not remember me, and hearken unto my words, they shall scourge them even unto destruction.

14 And it came to pass that those Lamanites who had united with the Nephites were numbered among the Nephites;

15 And **their curse was taken from them, and their skin became white** like unto the Nephites;

Today, **the Church disavows the theories advanced in the past** that black skin is a sign of divine disfavor or curse, or that it reflects unrighteous actions in a premortal life; that mixed-race marriages are a sin; or that blacks or people of any other race or ethnicity are inferior in any way to anyone else.

Between 1884 and 1904, Jane periodically contacted Church leaders—John Taylor, Wilford Woodruff, Zina D. H. Young, and Joseph F. Smith—and sought permission to receive her temple endowment and to be sealed. At that time, black Latter-day Saint men and women were not allowed to participate in most temple ordinances. In 1888, stake president Angus M. Cannon authorized Jane to perform baptisms for her deceased kindred. Church leaders eventually allowed her to be **sealed by proxy into the Joseph Smith family as a servant** in 1894, a unique occurrence. Although she did not receive the temple endowment or family sealings during her lifetime, these ordinances were performed in her behalf in 1979.
