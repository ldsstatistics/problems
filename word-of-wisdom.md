## Word of Wisdom

<br>

2 To be sent greeting; **not by commandment or constraint**, but by revelation and the word of wisdom, showing forth the order and will of God in the temporal salvation of all saints in the last days

17 Nevertheless, wheat for man, and corn for the ox, and oats for the horse, and rye for the fowls and for swine, and for all beasts of the field, and **barley for all useful animals, and for mild drinks**, as also other grain.

The revelation had been declared **not as a commandment** but as a caution. Many people would find it hard to give up using these powerful substances, and **Joseph did not insist on strict conformity. He continued to drink alcohol occasionally, and he and Emma sometimes drank coffee and tea**.

18 Yea, **all things which come of the earth, in the season thereof, are made for the benefit and the use of man**, both to please the eye and to gladden the heart;

19 Yea, for food and for raiment, for taste and for smell, to strengthen the body and to enliven the soul.

20 And it pleaseth God that he hath given all these things unto man; for unto this end were they made to be used, with judgment, not to excess, neither by extortion.

18 And he saith unto them, Are ye so without understanding also? Do ye not perceive, that **whatsoever thing from without entereth into the man, it cannot defile him;**

19 **Because it entereth not into his heart, but into the belly**, and goeth out into the draught, purging all meats?

20 And he said, **That which cometh out of the man, that defileth the man.**

21 For from within, out of the heart of men, proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, fornications, murders,

22 Thefts, covetousness, wickedness, deceit, lasciviousness, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, foolishness:

23 All these evil things come from within, and defile the man.

19 The Son of man came eating and **drinking**, and they say, Behold a man gluttonous, and a **winebibber**, a friend of publicans and sinners. But wisdom is justified of her children.

7 Jesus saith unto them, Fill the waterpots with water. And they filled them up to the brim.

8 And he saith unto them, Draw out now, and bear unto the governor of the feast. And they bare it.

9 When the ruler of the feast had tasted **the water that was made wine**, and knew not whence it was: (but the servants which drew the water knew;) the governor of the feast called the bridegroom,

10 And saith unto him, Every man at the beginning doth set forth good wine; and when men have well drunk, then that which is worse: **but thou hast kept the good wine until now**.

11 This beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and manifested forth his glory; and his disciples believed on him.
