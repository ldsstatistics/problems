## Temples and Masonry

**Joseph Smith never described how the endowment came to be, and there is no recorded revelation outlining its content**. However, Willard Richards, who was among the few to receive the endowment from Joseph Smith, testified that the ordinance was “governed by the principles of Revelation.” After Joseph Smith introduced the endowment, he directed Brigham Young to “organize and systematize all these ceremonies” so they could be administered within the temple. At first, the endowment ceremony was preserved only in the memory of the participants. In 1877, when the St. George Utah Temple was completed, Brigham Young directed a small group, including the temple’s president, Wilford Woodruff of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, to write down the ceremony to ensure consistency over time and between temples. The St. George Utah Temple was also where the first endowments were performed in behalf of the dead.

Though the endowment’s format of symbolic instruction and covenant making has remained the same, **the way the ordinance is administered has changed over time**. Originally, the ceremony lasted the better part of a day. Later generations of Church leaders sought divine guidance to streamline the ceremony, making it easier for members to perform vicarious endowments for the dead.

To help them understand the sacred ordinance and its importance, Brigham provided a description.

“Your endowment,” the sermon explained, “is to receive all those ordinances in the house of the Lord, which are necessary for you, after you have departed this life, to enable you to walk back to the presence of the Father, passing the angels who stand as sentinels, **enabled to give them the key words, the signs, and tokens** pertaining to the holy priesthood, and gain your eternal exaltation in spite of earth and hell.”

During the endowment ordinance, you will be invited to make certain covenants with God. These covenants include:

Law of Obedience, which includes striving to keep God’s commandments.

Law of Sacrifice, which means doing all we can to support the Lord’s work and repenting with a broken heart and contrite spirit.

Law of the Gospel, which is the higher law that He taught while He was on the earth.

Law of Chastity, which means that we have sexual relations only with the person to whom we are legally and lawfully wedded according to God’s law.

Law of Consecration, which means dedicating our time, talents, and everything with which the Lord has blessed us to building up Jesus Christ’s Church on the earth.

Some early Latter-day Saints were Masons. Heber C. Kimball, Hyrum Smith, and others belonged to Masonic lodges in the 1820s, and Joseph Smith joined the fraternity in March 1842 in Nauvoo, Illinois. **Soon after he became a Mason, Joseph introduced the temple endowment**. There are **some similarities between Masonic ceremonies and the endowment**, but there are also stark differences in their content and intent.

Freemasons (or Masons) meet in lodges, where they ritually reenact a story based on the brief biblical account of a man named Hiram, whom Solomon commissioned to work on the temple in Jerusalem. During the reenactment, Masons **advance by degrees, using handgrips, key words, and special clothing**.

On May 3, 1842, Joseph Smith enlisted a few men to prepare the space in his Red Brick Store in which the Nauvoo Masons met, “preparatory to giving endowments to a few Elders.” The next day, Joseph introduced the temple endowment for the first time to nine men, all of whom were also Masons. One of these men, Heber C. Kimball, wrote of this experience to fellow Apostle Parley P. Pratt, who was on a mission in England. “We have received some precious things through the Prophet on the priesthood,” Kimball wrote of the endowment, noting that “there is a **similarity of priesthood in masonry**.” He told Pratt that **Joseph believed Masonry was “taken from priesthood but has become degenerated**.” Joseph Fielding, another endowed Latter-day Saint and a Mason, noted similarly in his journal that **Masonry “seems to have been a Stepping Stone or Preparation for something else,” referring to the endowment**.

**Mormons in Nauvoo who experienced both Masonic rites and the endowment acknowledged similarities between some elements of the two ceremonies**, but they also testified that the endowment was the result of revelation. Willard Richards, writing Joseph Smith’s history, taught that the introduction of the endowment in Nauvoo was “governed by the principle of Revelation.” Joseph and his associates understood Masonry as an institution that preserved vestiges of ancient truth. They acknowledged parallels between Masonic rituals and the endowment but concluded, based on their experience with both, that the ordinance was divinely restored.

Emphasis on the similarities between the teaching styles and outward forms of Masonry and the temple endowment obscures significant differences in their substance. Masonic ceremonies promote self-improvement, brotherhood, charity, and fidelity to truth for the purpose of making better men, who in turn make a better society. During temple ordinances, men and women covenant with God to obey His laws for the purpose of gaining exaltation through the Atonement of Jesus Christ. **Masonic rituals deliver stage-by-stage instruction using dramatization and symbolic gestures and clothing, with content based on Masonic legends**. The endowment employs similar teaching devices, but it draws primarily upon the revelations and inspired translations given to Joseph Smith for its content.
