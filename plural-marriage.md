The exact number of women to whom he was sealed in his lifetime is unknown because the evidence is fragmentary. 

[Footnote 24] **Careful estimates put the number between 30 and 40**

Torn between the Lord’s mandate to practice plural marriage and Emma’s opposition, Joseph sometimes chose to marry women **without Emma’s knowledge**, creating distressing situations for everyone involved. In early May, Emma took Emily and Eliza aside and explained the principle of plural marriage to them. She had told Joseph that she would consent to him being sealed to two additional wives as long as she could choose them, and she had chosen Emily and Eliza, apparently **unaware that Joseph had already been sealed to them**. Rather than mention her former sealing, Emily believed that keeping silent on the matter was the best thing for her to do. A few days later, she and Eliza were **again sealed to Joseph**, this time with Emma as a witness.

52 And let mine handmaid, Emma Smith, receive all those that have been **given unto** my servant Joseph, and who are virtuous and pure before me; and those who are not pure, and have said they were pure, **shall be destroyed**, saith the Lord God.

53 For I am the Lord thy God, and ye shall obey my voice; and I give unto my servant Joseph that he shall be made ruler over many things; for he hath been faithful over a few things, and from henceforth I will strengthen him.

54 And I command mine handmaid, Emma Smith, to abide and cleave unto my servant Joseph, and to none else. But if she will not abide this commandment **she shall be destroyed**, saith the Lord; for **I am the Lord thy God, and will destroy her if she abide not in my law**.

61 And again, as pertaining to the law of the priesthood—if any man espouse a virgin, and desire to espouse another, and the first give her consent, and if he espouse the second, and they are virgins, and have vowed to no other man, then is he justified; he cannot commit adultery for **they are given unto him**; for he cannot commit adultery with that that **belongeth unto him** and to no one else.

62 And if **he have ten virgins given unto him** by this law, he cannot commit adultery, for **they belong to him**, and they are **given unto him**; therefore is he justified.

63 But if one or either of the ten virgins, after she is espoused, shall be with another man, she has committed adultery, and **shall be destroyed**; for **they are given unto him** to multiply and replenish the earth, according to my commandment, and to fulfil the promise which was given by my Father before the foundation of the world, and for their exaltation in the eternal worlds, that they may bear the souls of men; for herein is the work of my Father continued, that he may be glorified.

64 And again, verily, verily, I say unto you, if any man have a wife, who holds the keys of this power, and he teaches unto her the law of my priesthood, as pertaining to these things, then shall she believe and administer unto him, **or she shall be destroyed, saith the Lord your God; for I will destroy her**; for I will magnify my name upon all those who receive and abide in my law.

65 Therefore, it shall be lawful in me, **if she receive not this law**, for him to receive all things whatsoever I, the Lord his God, will give unto him, because she did not believe and administer unto him according to my word; and **she then becomes the transgressor; and he is exempt from the law of Sarah**, who administered unto Abraham according to the law when I commanded Abraham to take Hagar to wife.

After Joseph’s death, many of his plural wives were sealed to other Church leaders for this life only, including Zina, **who was sealed to Brigham Young in 1846 while still civilly married to Henry**.

Toward the end of his life, Brigham was widely known as the father of a large plural family. He was sealed to **over 50** women, many but not all of whom lived with him. Some likely understood their sealing to Brigham as having spiritual rather than domestic significance. Brigham and 16 of his wives had a total of 56 children.

38 David also **received many wives and concubines**, and also Solomon and Moses my servants, as also many others of my servants, from the beginning of creation until this time; and **in nothing did they sin** save in those things which they received not of me.

39 David’s wives and concubines **were given unto him** of me, by the hand of Nathan, my servant, and others of the prophets who had the keys of this power; and **in none of these things did he sin against me save in the case of Uriah and his wife**; and, therefore he hath fallen from his exaltation, and received his portion; and he shall not inherit them out of the world, for I gave them unto another, saith the Lord.

23 But the word of God burdens me because of your grosser crimes. For behold, thus saith the Lord: This people begin to wax in iniquity; they understand not the scriptures, for they seek to excuse themselves in committing whoredoms, because of the things which were written concerning David, and Solomon his son.

24 Behold, David and Solomon truly had many wives and concubines, **which thing was abominable before me, saith the Lord**.

25 Wherefore, thus saith the Lord, I have led this people forth out of the land of Jerusalem, by the power of mine arm, that I might raise up unto me a righteous branch from the fruit of the loins of Joseph.

26 Wherefore, I the Lord God will not suffer that this people shall do like unto them of old.

27 Wherefore, my brethren, hear me, and hearken to the word of the Lord: For **there shall not any man among you have save it be one wife; and concubines he shall have none**;

28 For I, the Lord God, delight in the chastity of women. And whoredoms are an abomination before me; thus saith the Lord of Hosts.

29 Wherefore, this people shall keep my commandments, saith the Lord of Hosts, or cursed be the land for their sakes.

30 For if I will, saith the Lord of Hosts, raise up seed unto me, I will command my people; otherwise they shall hearken unto these things.
