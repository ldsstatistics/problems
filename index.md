The youngest was Helen Mar Kimball, daughter of Joseph’s close friends Heber C. and Vilate Murray Kimball, who was sealed to Joseph **several months before her 15th birthday**.

The exact number of women to whom he was sealed in his lifetime is unknown because the evidence is fragmentary.

Torn between the Lord’s mandate to practice plural marriage and Emma’s opposition, Joseph sometimes chose to marry women **without Emma’s knowledge**, creating distressing situations for everyone involved. In early May, Emma took Emily and Eliza aside and explained the principle of plural marriage to them. She had told Joseph that she would consent to him being sealed to two additional wives as long as she could choose them, and she had chosen Emily and Eliza, apparently **unaware that Joseph had already been sealed to them**. Rather than mention her former sealing, Emily believed that keeping silent on the matter was the best thing for her to do. A few days later, she and Eliza were **again sealed to Joseph**, this time with Emma as a witness.

54 And I command mine handmaid, Emma Smith, to abide and cleave unto my servant Joseph, and to none else. But if she will not abide this commandment **she shall be destroyed**, saith the Lord; for **I am the Lord thy God, and will destroy her if she abide not in my law**.

61 And again, as pertaining to the law of the priesthood—if any man espouse a virgin, and desire to espouse another, and the first give her consent, and if he espouse the second, and they are virgins, and have vowed to no other man, then is he justified; he cannot commit adultery for **they are given unto him**; for he cannot commit adultery with that that **belongeth unto him** and to no one else.

62 And if **he have ten virgins given unto him** by this law, he cannot commit adultery, for **they belong to him**, and they are **given unto him**; therefore is he justified.

After Joseph’s death, many of his plural wives were sealed to other Church leaders for this life only, including Zina, **who was sealed to Brigham Young in 1846 while still civilly married to Henry**.

38 David also **received many wives and concubines**, and also Solomon and Moses my servants, as also many others of my servants, from the beginning of creation until this time; and **in nothing did they sin** save in those things which they received not of me.

39 David’s wives and concubines **were given unto him** of me, by the hand of Nathan, my servant, and others of the prophets who had the keys of this power; and **in none of these things did he sin against me save in the case of Uriah and his wife**; and, therefore he hath fallen from his exaltation, and received his portion; and he shall not inherit them out of the world, for I gave them unto another, saith the Lord.

23 But the word of God burdens me because of your grosser crimes. For behold, thus saith the Lord: This people begin to wax in iniquity; they understand not the scriptures, for they seek to excuse themselves in committing whoredoms, because of the things which were written concerning David, and Solomon his son.

24 Behold, David and Solomon truly had many wives and concubines, **which thing was abominable before me, saith the Lord**.

25 Wherefore, thus saith the Lord, I have led this people forth out of the land of Jerusalem, by the power of mine arm, that I might raise up unto me a righteous branch from the fruit of the loins of Joseph.

26 Wherefore, I the Lord God will not suffer that this people shall do like unto them of old.

27 Wherefore, my brethren, hear me, and hearken to the word of the Lord: For **there shall not any man among you have save it be one wife; and concubines he shall have none**;

28 For I, the Lord God, delight in the chastity of women. And whoredoms are an abomination before me; thus saith the Lord of Hosts.

29 Wherefore, this people shall keep my commandments, saith the Lord of Hosts, or cursed be the land for their sakes.

30 For if I will, saith the Lord of Hosts, raise up seed unto me, I will command my people; otherwise they shall hearken unto these things.

## Race and the Priesthood

<br>

Like other groups of Christians at this time, however, **many white Saints wrongly viewed black people as inferior**, believing that black skin was the result of God’s curse on the biblical figures Cain and Ham. Some had even begun to teach the false idea that black skin was evidence of a person’s unrighteous actions in the premortal life.

**Brigham Young shared some of these views**, but before leaving Winter Quarters, he had also told a mixed-race Saint that all people were alike unto God. “Of one blood has God made all flesh,” he had said. “We don’t care about the color.”

<br>

In 1850, the U.S. Congress created Utah Territory, and the U.S. president appointed Brigham Young to the position of territorial governor. Southerners who had converted to the Church and migrated to Utah with their slaves raised the question of slavery’s legal status in the territory. In two speeches delivered before the Utah territorial legislature in January and February 1852, **Brigham Young announced a policy restricting men of black African descent from priesthood ordination**. At the same time, President Young said that at some future day, black Church members would “have [all] the privilege and more” enjoyed by other members.

The justifications for this restriction echoed the widespread ideas about racial inferiority that had been used to argue for the **legalization of black “servitude” in the Territory of Utah**. According to one view, which had been promulgated in the United States from at least the 1730s, blacks descended from the same lineage as the biblical Cain, who slew his brother Abel. Those who accepted this view believed that God’s “curse” on Cain was the mark of a dark skin. Black servitude was sometimes viewed as a second curse placed upon Noah’s grandson Canaan as a result of Ham’s indiscretion toward his father. Although slavery was not a significant factor in Utah’s economy and was soon abolished, the restriction on priesthood ordinations remained.

<br>

Following the death of Brigham Young, **subsequent Church presidents restricted blacks from receiving the temple endowment or being married in the temple**. Over time, Church leaders and members advanced many theories to explain the priesthood and temple restrictions. None of these explanations is accepted today as the official doctrine of the Church.

<br>

The **curse of Cain** was often put forward as justification for the priesthood and temple restrictions. Around the turn of the century, another explanation gained currency: **blacks were said to have been less than fully valiant** in the premortal battle against Lucifer and, **as a consequence, were restricted from priesthood and temple blessings**.

21 And he had caused the **cursing** to come upon them, yea, even a sore **cursing, because of their iniquity**. For behold, they had hardened their hearts against him, that they had become like unto a flint; wherefore, **as they were white, and exceedingly fair and delightsome, that they might not be enticing unto my people the Lord God did cause a skin of blackness** to come upon them.

22 And thus saith the Lord God: I will cause that they shall be **loathsome** unto thy people, save they shall repent of their iniquities.

23 And **cursed shall be the seed of him that mixeth with their seed; for they shall be cursed even with the same cursing**. And the Lord spake it, and it was done.

24 And because of their cursing which was upon them **they did become an idle people, full of mischief and subtlety, and did seek in the wilderness for beasts of prey**.

25 And the Lord God said unto me: They shall be **a scourge unto thy seed, to stir them up in remembrance of me**; and inasmuch as they will not remember me, and hearken unto my words, they shall scourge them even unto destruction.

Today, **the Church disavows the theories advanced in the past** that black skin is a sign of divine disfavor or curse, or that it reflects unrighteous actions in a premortal life; that mixed-race marriages are a sin; or that blacks or people of any other race or ethnicity are inferior in any way to anyone else.

Between 1884 and 1904, Jane periodically contacted Church leaders—John Taylor, Wilford Woodruff, Zina D. H. Young, and Joseph F. Smith—and sought permission to receive her temple endowment and to be sealed. At that time, black Latter-day Saint men and women were not allowed to participate in most temple ordinances. In 1888, stake president Angus M. Cannon authorized Jane to perform baptisms for her deceased kindred. Church leaders eventually allowed her to be **sealed by proxy into the Joseph Smith family as a servant** in 1894, a unique occurrence. Although she did not receive the temple endowment or family sealings during her lifetime, these ordinances were performed in her behalf in 1979.

## Translation and Historicity of the Book of Abraham

<br>

Some evidence suggests that Joseph studied the characters on the Egyptian papyri and attempted to learn the Egyptian language. His history reports that, in July 1835, he was “continually engaged in translating an alphabet to the Book of Abraham, and arrangeing a grammar of the Egyptian language as practiced by the ancients.” This “grammar,” as it was called, consisted of columns of hieroglyphic characters followed by English translations recorded in a large notebook by Joseph’s scribe, William W. Phelps. Another manuscript, written by Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery, has Egyptian characters followed by explanations.

The relationship of these documents to the book of Abraham is not fully understood. **Neither the rules nor the translations in the grammar book correspond to those recognized by Egyptologists today.**

-- [Gospel Topics Essay - Translation and Historicity of the Book of Abraham](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/gospel-topics-essays/translation-and-historicity-of-the-book-of-abraham)

<br>

After the Latter-day Saints left Nauvoo, the Egyptian artifacts remained behind. Joseph Smith’s family sold the papyri and the mummies in 1856. The papyri were divided up and sold to various parties; historians believe that most were destroyed in the Great Chicago Fire of 1871. Ten papyrus fragments once in Joseph Smith’s possession ended up in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. In 1967, the museum transferred these fragments to the Church, which subsequently published them in the Church’s magazine, the Improvement Era.

The discovery of the papyrus fragments renewed debate about Joseph Smith’s translation. **The fragments included one vignette, or illustration, that appears in the book of Abraham as facsimile 1**. Long before the fragments were published by the Church, **some Egyptologists had said that Joseph Smith’s explanations of the various elements of these facsimiles did not match their own interpretations of these drawings**. Joseph Smith had published the facsimiles as freestanding drawings, cut off from the hieroglyphs or hieratic characters that originally surrounded the vignettes. The discovery of the fragments meant that readers could now see the hieroglyphs and characters immediately surrounding the vignette that became facsimile 1.

**None of the characters on the papyrus fragments mentioned Abraham’s name or any of the events recorded in the book of Abraham. Mormon and non-Mormon Egyptologists agree that the characters on the fragments do not match the translation given in the book of Abraham**, though there is not unanimity, even among non-Mormon scholars, about the proper interpretation of the vignettes on these fragments. **Scholars have identified the papyrus fragments as parts of standard funerary texts that were deposited with mummified bodies. These fragments date to between the third century B.C.E. and the first century C.E., long after Abraham lived.**

## Book of Mormon and DNA Studies

<br>

Although the primary purpose of the Book of Mormon is more spiritual than historical, some people have wondered whether the migrations it describes are compatible with scientific studies of ancient America. The discussion has centered on the field of population genetics and developments in DNA science. Some have contended that the migrations mentioned in the Book of Mormon did not occur because **the majority of DNA identified to date in modern native peoples most closely resembles that of eastern Asian populations.**

-- [Gospel Topics Essay - Book of Mormon and DNA Studies](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/gospel-topics-essays/book-of-mormon-and-dna-studies)

<br>

The evidence assembled to date suggests that **the majority of Native Americans carry largely Asian DNA**. Scientists theorize that in an era that predated Book of Mormon accounts, **a relatively small group of people migrated from northeast Asia to the Americas by way of a land bridge that connected Siberia to Alaska. These people, scientists say, spread rapidly to fill North and South America and were likely the primary ancestors of modern American Indians.**

<br>

The 2006 update to the introduction of the Book of Mormon reflects this understanding by stating that Book of Mormon peoples were **“among the ancestors of the American Indians.”**

[Footnote 10] The introduction, which is not part of the text of the Book of Mormon, previously stated that the Lamanites were the **“principal ancestors of the American Indians.”**

## Book of Mormon Translation

<br>

As a young man during the 1820s, Joseph Smith, like others in his day, **used a seer stone to look for lost objects and buried treasure**. As Joseph grew to understand his prophetic calling, he learned that he could **use this stone for the higher purpose of translating scripture**.

-- [Gospel Topics Essay - Book of Mormon Translation](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/gospel-topics-essays/book-of-mormon-translation)

<br>

Twenty-one-year-old Emma Hale first heard about Joseph Smith when he came to work for Josiah Stowell in the fall of 1825. **Josiah had hired the young man and his father to help him find buried treasure**. Local legends claimed that a band of explorers had mined a silver deposit and hidden the treasure in the area hundreds of years earlier. Knowing Joseph had a gift for using seer stones, Josiah offered him **good wages** and a share of the findings if he would help in the search.

-- [Saints, Volume 1 - Chapter 4](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/history/saints-v1/04-be-watchful)

<br>

In 1826, Josiah Stowell **hired** Joseph Smith to help look for lost Spanish silver near the border of New York and Pennsylvania. Someone in the community, possibly a member of Stowell’s extended family, accused Joseph of gazing into a stone to discover lost property. As a result, Joseph was ordered to appear before justice of the peace Albert Neely in Chenango County, likely on charges of disorderly conduct. His arrest appears to have been based on a statute in New York state law outlawing “pretending . . . to discover where lost goods may be found.” Four accounts describe this hearing, all of which suggest Joseph suffered no serious legal consequences in its aftermath. Other details vary and sometimes contradict each other.

In his testimony, **Joseph readily agreed he had used his seer stone off and on to look for lost property**, but he had given up the practice—it hurt his eyes, he said. He had never solicited such work and “had always rather declined having anything to do with this business.” The judge inspected the stone and questioned other witnesses, including Joseph’s father, Joseph Smith Sr., and Joseph’s employer, Josiah Stowell.

Joseph Sr. and Josiah Stowell testified that Joseph had responded to requests to use his seer stone only to assist friends or, in Stowell’s case, to help Stowell and **other contracted workers** on a treasure dig. Stowell trusted Joseph and appreciated his work. Joseph Sr. hoped his son would not abuse the gift in searching for earthly treasures and prayed God would reveal His will to the young man. Some other witnesses who testified believed in Joseph’s skill; others did not.

The outcome of the hearing remains a puzzle. **A purported court record indicates the judge found Joseph guilty.** A neighbor of Josiah Stowell claimed the court “condemned” Joseph but allowed him to escape on account of his youth. A friend of the judge who claimed to have taken notes at the hearing wrote that the judge accepted Stowell’s testimony and discharged Joseph. Oliver Cowdery, who did not attend the hearing (he met Joseph Smith about three years later), mentioned the most likely result in light of missing documentation, that Joseph was acquitted of being a disorderly person.

<br>

Nevertheless, the scribes and others who observed the translation left numerous accounts that give insight into the process. Some accounts indicate that Joseph studied the characters on the plates. Most of the accounts speak of Joseph’s use of the Urim and Thummim (either the interpreters or the seer stone), and **many accounts refer to his use of a single stone**. According to these accounts, **Joseph placed either the interpreters or the seer stone in a hat, pressed his face into the hat to block out extraneous light, and read aloud the English words that appeared on the instrument**.

## 1832 Account of the First Vision

<br>

The **earliest known account** of the First Vision, the **only account written in Joseph Smith’s own hand**, is found in a short, unpublished autobiography Joseph Smith produced in the second half of 1832. In the account, Joseph Smith described his consciousness of his own sins and his frustration at being unable to find a church that matched the one he had read about in the New Testament and that would lead him to redemption. He emphasized Jesus Christ’s Atonement and the personal redemption it offered. He wrote that “the Lord” appeared and forgave him of his sins. As a result of the vision, Joseph experienced joy and love, though, as he noted, he could find no one who believed his account.

<br>

Thus, from the age of twelve years to fifteen I pondered many things in my heart concerning the situation of the world of mankind, the contentions and divisions, the wickedness and abominations, and the darkness which pervaded the minds of mankind. My mind became exceedingly distressed, for **I became convicted of my sins, and by searching the scriptures I found that mankind did not come unto the Lord but that they had apostatized from the true and living faith, and there was no society or denomination that was built upon the gospel of Jesus Christ as recorded in the New Testament**. I felt to mourn for my own sins and for the sins of the world, for I learned in the scriptures that God was the same yesterday, today, and forever, that he was no respecter of persons, for he was God.

For I looked upon the sun, the glorious luminary of the earth, and also the moon, rolling in their majesty through the heavens, and also the stars shining in their courses, and the earth also upon which I stood, and the beasts of the ﬁeld, and the fowls of heaven, and the ﬁsh of the waters, and also man walking forth upon the face of the earth in majesty and in the strength of beauty, whose power and intelligence in governing the things which are so exceedingly great and marvelous, even in the likeness of him who created them. And when I considered upon these things, my heart exclaimed, “Well hath the wise man said, ‘It is a fool that saith in his heart, there is no God.’” My heart exclaimed, “All, all these bear testimony and bespeak an omnipotent and omnipresent power, a being who maketh laws and decreeth and bindeth all things in their bounds, who ﬁlleth eternity, who was and is and will be from all eternity to eternity.” And I considered all these things and that that being seeketh such to worship him as worship him in spirit and in truth.

Therefore, **I cried unto the Lord for mercy**, for there was none else to whom I could go and obtain mercy. And the Lord heard my cry in the wilderness, and while in the attitude of calling upon the Lord, **in the sixteenth year of my age**, a pillar of light above the brightness of the sun at noonday came down from above and rested upon me. **I was ﬁlled with the spirit of God, and the Lord opened the heavens upon me and I saw the Lord.**

And he spake unto me, saying, “Joseph, my son, **thy sins are forgiven thee**. Go thy way, walk in my statutes, and keep my commandments. Behold, I am the Lord of glory. I was crucified for the world, that all those who believe on my name may have eternal life. Behold, the world lieth in sin at this time, and none doeth good, no, not one. They have turned aside from the gospel and keep not my commandments. They draw near to me with their lips while their hearts are far from me. And mine anger is kindling against the inhabitants of the earth, to visit them according to their ungodliness and to bring to pass that which hath been spoken by the mouth of the prophets and apostles. Behold and lo, I come quickly, as it is written of me, in the cloud, clothed in the glory of my Father.”
