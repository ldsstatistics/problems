The exact number of women to whom he was sealed in his lifetime is unknown because the evidence is fragmentary. 

[Footnote 24] **Careful estimates put the number between 30 and 40**

Torn between the Lord’s mandate to practice plural marriage and Emma’s opposition, Joseph sometimes chose to marry women **without Emma’s knowledge**, creating distressing situations for everyone involved. In early May, Emma took Emily and Eliza aside and explained the principle of plural marriage to them. She had told Joseph that she would consent to him being sealed to two additional wives as long as she could choose them, and she had chosen Emily and Eliza, apparently **unaware that Joseph had already been sealed to them**. Rather than mention her former sealing, Emily believed that keeping silent on the matter was the best thing for her to do. A few days later, she and Eliza were **again sealed to Joseph**, this time with Emma as a witness.

54 And I command mine handmaid, Emma Smith, to abide and cleave unto my servant Joseph, and to none else. But if she will not abide this commandment **she shall be destroyed**, saith the Lord; for **I am the Lord thy God, and will destroy her if she abide not in my law**.

61 And again, as pertaining to the law of the priesthood—if any man espouse a virgin, and desire to espouse another, and the first give her consent, and if he espouse the second, and they are virgins, and have vowed to no other man, then is he justified; he cannot commit adultery for **they are given unto him**; for he cannot commit adultery with that that **belongeth unto him** and to no one else.

62 And if **he have ten virgins given unto him** by this law, he cannot commit adultery, for **they belong to him**, and they are **given unto him**; therefore is he justified.

64 And again, verily, verily, I say unto you, if any man have a wife, who holds the keys of this power, and he teaches unto her the law of my priesthood, as pertaining to these things, then shall she believe and administer unto him, **or she shall be destroyed, saith the Lord your God; for I will destroy her**; for I will magnify my name upon all those who receive and abide in my law.

After Joseph’s death, many of his plural wives were sealed to other Church leaders for this life only, including Zina, **who was sealed to Brigham Young in 1846 while still civilly married to Henry**.

38 David also **received many wives and concubines**, and also Solomon and Moses my servants, as also many others of my servants, from the beginning of creation until this time; and **in nothing did they sin** save in those things which they received not of me.

39 David’s wives and concubines **were given unto him** of me, by the hand of Nathan, my servant, and others of the prophets who had the keys of this power; and in none of these things did he sin against me save in the case of Uriah and his wife; and, therefore he hath fallen from his exaltation, and received his portion; and he shall not inherit them out of the world, for I gave them unto another, saith the Lord.

23 But the word of God burdens me because of your grosser crimes. For behold, thus saith the Lord: This people begin to wax in iniquity; they understand not the scriptures, for they seek to excuse themselves in committing whoredoms, because of the things which were written concerning David, and Solomon his son.

24 Behold, David and Solomon truly had many wives and concubines, **which thing was abominable before me, saith the Lord**.

25 Wherefore, thus saith the Lord, I have led this people forth out of the land of Jerusalem, by the power of mine arm, that I might raise up unto me a righteous branch from the fruit of the loins of Joseph.

26 Wherefore, I the Lord God will not suffer that this people shall do like unto them of old.

27 Wherefore, my brethren, hear me, and hearken to the word of the Lord: For **there shall not any man among you have save it be one wife; and concubines he shall have none**;

28 For I, the Lord God, delight in the chastity of women. And whoredoms are an abomination before me; thus saith the Lord of Hosts.

29 Wherefore, this people shall keep my commandments, saith the Lord of Hosts, or cursed be the land for their sakes.

30 For if I will, saith the Lord of Hosts, raise up seed unto me, I will command my people; otherwise they shall hearken unto these things.

## Race and the Priesthood

<br>

Like other groups of Christians at this time, however, **many white Saints wrongly viewed black people as inferior**, believing that black skin was the result of God’s curse on the biblical figures Cain and Ham. Some had even begun to teach the false idea that black skin was evidence of a person’s unrighteous actions in the premortal life.

**Brigham Young shared some of these views**, but before leaving Winter Quarters, he had also told a mixed-race Saint that all people were alike unto God. “Of one blood has God made all flesh,” he had said. “We don’t care about the color.”

In 1850, the U.S. Congress created Utah Territory, and the U.S. president appointed Brigham Young to the position of territorial governor. Southerners who had converted to the Church and migrated to Utah with their slaves raised the question of slavery’s legal status in the territory. In two speeches delivered before the Utah territorial legislature in January and February 1852, **Brigham Young announced a policy restricting men of black African descent from priesthood ordination**. At the same time, President Young said that at some future day, black Church members would “have [all] the privilege and more” enjoyed by other members.

The justifications for this restriction echoed the widespread ideas about racial inferiority that had been used to argue for the **legalization of black “servitude” in the Territory of Utah**. According to one view, which had been promulgated in the United States from at least the 1730s, blacks descended from the same lineage as the biblical Cain, who slew his brother Abel. Those who accepted this view believed that God’s “curse” on Cain was the mark of a dark skin. Black servitude was sometimes viewed as a second curse placed upon Noah’s grandson Canaan as a result of Ham’s indiscretion toward his father. Although slavery was not a significant factor in Utah’s economy and was soon abolished, the restriction on priesthood ordinations remained.

Following the death of Brigham Young, **subsequent Church presidents restricted blacks from receiving the temple endowment or being married in the temple**. Over time, Church leaders and members advanced many theories to explain the priesthood and temple restrictions. None of these explanations is accepted today as the official doctrine of the Church.

The **curse of Cain** was often put forward as justification for the priesthood and temple restrictions. Around the turn of the century, another explanation gained currency: **blacks were said to have been less than fully valiant** in the premortal battle against Lucifer and, **as a consequence, were restricted from priesthood and temple blessings**.

21 And he had caused the **cursing** to come upon them, yea, even a sore **cursing, because of their iniquity**. For behold, they had hardened their hearts against him, that they had become like unto a flint; wherefore, **as they were white, and exceedingly fair and delightsome, that they might not be enticing unto my people the Lord God did cause a skin of blackness** to come upon them.

22 And thus saith the Lord God: I will cause that they shall be **loathsome** unto thy people, save they shall repent of their iniquities.

23 And **cursed shall be the seed of him that mixeth with their seed; for they shall be cursed even with the same cursing**. And the Lord spake it, and it was done.

24 And because of their cursing which was upon them **they did become an idle people, full of mischief and subtlety, and did seek in the wilderness for beasts of prey**.

25 And the Lord God said unto me: They shall be **a scourge unto thy seed, to stir them up in remembrance of me**; and inasmuch as they will not remember me, and hearken unto my words, they shall scourge them even unto destruction.

14 And it came to pass that those Lamanites who had united with the Nephites were numbered among the Nephites;

15 And their curse was taken from them, and their skin became white like unto the Nephites;

Today, **the Church disavows the theories advanced in the past** that black skin is a sign of divine disfavor or curse, or that it reflects unrighteous actions in a premortal life; that mixed-race marriages are a sin; or that blacks or people of any other race or ethnicity are inferior in any way to anyone else.

Between 1884 and 1904, Jane periodically contacted Church leaders—John Taylor, Wilford Woodruff, Zina D. H. Young, and Joseph F. Smith—and sought permission to receive her temple endowment and to be sealed. At that time, black Latter-day Saint men and women were not allowed to participate in most temple ordinances. In 1888, stake president Angus M. Cannon authorized Jane to perform baptisms for her deceased kindred. Church leaders eventually allowed her to be **sealed by proxy into the Joseph Smith family as a servant** in 1894, a unique occurrence. Although she did not receive the temple endowment or family sealings during her lifetime, these ordinances were performed in her behalf in 1979.
